<!-- motion.xml
Generic motion controlled by a Python script.
This preset is designed to be loaded after cfd.xml.

To use it, just include this file, and later set the initial values for the
variables:
motion_r = Position of the center of rotation
motion_drdt = Linear velocity towards x, y, z
motion_a = Rotation angles phi, theta, psi
motion_dadt = angular velocities dphidt, dthetadt, dpsidt

You should provide a Motion.py script in your execution path, where such
variables should be set each time step

        defined, in order to set the motion parameters for the current time
        step -->
